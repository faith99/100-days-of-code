# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2020
Just joined the challenge and still going over the rules and guides

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
